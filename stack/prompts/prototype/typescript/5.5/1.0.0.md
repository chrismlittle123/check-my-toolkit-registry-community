## TypeScript 5.5 Coding Standards - PROTOTYPE

Guidelines for rapid prototyping and experimentation. Focus on speed over polish.

### Target Version

- Target TypeScript 5.5 specifically.
- Target Node.js 20 runtime.

### Security

- Never commit secrets, API keys, or credentials to files. Use environment variables.

### Tooling

- Use `pnpm` for package management.
- Use `package.json` for project configuration.
- Use `.nvmrc` to specify Node.js version.

### Dependencies

- Pin versions with caret in `package.json` (e.g., `"express": "^4.18.0"`).
- Lockfile (`pnpm-lock.yaml`) is optional for prototypes.

### Imports

- Remove obviously unused imports.
- Import organization is flexible during prototyping.

### Types

- Type hints are optional but encouraged for public APIs.

### Error Handling

- Catch exceptions at main entry points to provide useful error messages.
- Let unexpected errors propagate with full stack traces for debugging.

### Testing

- Testing is optional for prototypes.
