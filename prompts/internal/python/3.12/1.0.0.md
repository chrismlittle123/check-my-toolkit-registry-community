## Python 3.12 Coding Standards - INTERNAL

Standards for internal tools, services, and team-facing applications.

### Target Version

- Target Python 3.12 specifically.
- Use Python 3.12 features where appropriate.

### Tooling

- Use `uv` for all package management and virtual environments.
- Use `pyproject.toml` for project configuration.
- Use `uv venv` to create virtual environments.
- Use `uv python` to manage Python versions.
- Use `ruff` for linting and formatting.

### Dependencies

- Pin versions compatibly in `pyproject.toml` (e.g., `requests~=2.28`).
- Commit `uv.lock` to ensure reproducible installs across the team.
- Use `uv sync` to install dependencies from lockfile.

### Imports

- Remove all unused imports.
- Sort imports in the standard order: standard library, third-party, local.
- Use absolute imports over relative imports.

### Testing

- Every new feature that is implemented must come with a unit test and integration test.

### Types

- Add type hints to all function signatures.
- Avoid using free strings, use enums where appropriate.
- Avoid using free dictionaries, use pydantic models for all dictionary-like objects.

### Error Handling

- Be specific with exception types. Avoid bare `except:` clauses.
- Use context managers (`with` statements) for resource management.
